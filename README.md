# Safe Crib With Auto Hazard-Detection

## Project Overview

**Duration**: December 2022 – May 2023

The "Safe Crib With Auto Hazard-Detection" is an innovative project aimed at utilizing technology to enhance the safety of infants while in their cribs. The project focuses on developing a system that employs various sensor arrays to monitor the baby's movements and posture in the crib, alerting caregivers to potential unintentional falls and other hazards. 

## Features and Achievements

- Utilization of various sensor arrays to closely monitor baby's movements and posture within the crib, providing alerts for unintentional falls.
- Independent PCB design, forming the central control hub for the sensor array and a Bluetooth module facilitating data transmission.
- Simulation and testing of PCB conditions with extensive sensor arrays connected, using Kicad and Cadence® Virtuoso®.
- Prototyping and real-situation sensor accuracy testing with the aid of a breadboard and a crib model crafted with machine tools.
- Implementation of Arduino IDE encoder to program the receiving PCB, and store the predetermined method for decoding transmitted bit signals.
- Nominated for a showcase during the Senior Project design and approval stage, securing a full score in the evaluation phase.
